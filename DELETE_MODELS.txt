The following MongoDB model files should be deleted as they are no longer needed:

- User.js
- Family.js  
- Member.js
- Wallet.js
- Category.js
- Expense.js
- Income.js
- Task.js
- Memory.js
- HealthRecord.js
- Document.js

These have been replaced with Firebase Realtime Database operations in the controllers.
