# Family Login Setup Guide

## How to Create Different Logins for Family Members

### Step 1: Family Owner Setup
1. **Register as Family Owner**: The first person creates an account and becomes the family owner
2. **Complete Family Setup**: Set up family name and basic information

### Step 2: Add Family Members with Login Access

1. **Go to Settings**: Navigate to Settings → Family Members
2. **Click "Add Member"**: Fill in member details:
   - Name, age, date of birth
   - Gender, relationship, role
   - Contact information

3. **Enable Login Account**: 
   - ✅ Check "Create login account for this member"
   - Enter unique email address (e.g., `john.son@family.com`)
   - Set a password for the member
   - Click "Add Member"

### Step 3: Family Members Can Now Login

Each family member can now:
1. **Visit the Login Page**: Go to the FamilyHub login
2. **Use Their Credentials**: 
   - Email: The email you set up for them
   - Password: The password you created
3. **Access Their Tasks**: They'll see tasks assigned to them
4. **Mark Tasks Complete**: Click the green "Mark Complete" button

### Example Family Setup:

**Family Owner (Dad):**
- Email: `dad@smith.family`
- Password: `dad123`
- Role: Owner (can create tasks, approve completions)

**Mom:**
- Email: `mom@smith.family` 
- Password: `mom123`
- Role: Adult (can create tasks, approve completions)

**Teen Son:**
- Email: `alex@smith.family`
- Password: `alex123`
- Role: Teen (can complete tasks, limited access)

**Child Daughter:**
- Email: `emma@smith.family`
- Password: `emma123`
- Role: Child (can complete basic tasks)

### Task Workflow:

1. **Owner/Adult creates task** → Assigns to family member
2. **Family member logs in** → Sees their assigned tasks
3. **Member completes task** → Clicks "Mark Complete" button
4. **Owner/Adult approves** → Points are awarded automatically

### Role Permissions:

| Feature | Owner | Adult | Teen | Child | Guest |
|---------|-------|-------|------|-------|-------|
| Create Tasks | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Complete Tasks | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Approve Tasks | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Finance Access | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Settings | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

### Tips:

- **Use Simple Emails**: Create easy-to-remember emails like `firstname@familyname.com`
- **Secure Passwords**: Use different passwords for each member
- **Test Logins**: Have each member test their login before assigning tasks
- **Role Assignment**: Choose appropriate roles based on age and responsibility level

### Troubleshooting:

- **Email Already Exists**: Each member needs a unique email address
- **Can't See Tasks**: Make sure the member is logged in with their own account
- **Permission Denied**: Check the member's role permissions
- **Login Issues**: Verify email and password are correct

Now your family can have individual logins and each member can mark their tasks complete independently!
